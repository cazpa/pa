# Pi√±ol's Adventure: Concept

-- INTRO --

You start the game as player an IT Support Junior of 26 years old who works in a company from 09:00 AM to 18:00 PM from Monday to Thursday and from 09:00 AM to 15:30 PM on Friday. The night of the 01 of January of 2019 he has a nightmare. An Old God of unkown name invades his mind and marks him as his representative in earth with the mission of killing X number of people in order to create a sacrifice big enough for his master to be released. 

Pepo starts at the morning of the 02 of january and he cannot go to work due to paranoia and a general sick feeling in his body. 

There are 2 main scenarios:

-- HOME --

In home is where you choose your daily schedul and the actitude you apply on all the things you gotta do. 

-- WORK --

-- Things to consider --

# There are things that you must keep in check:
# - Hydration
# - Energy
# - Hunger
# - Physicall fitness
# - Paranoia
# - Entertainment

# (Alcohol, cigarettes and such will reduce your health.)


You can make choices; to work normally, hard, or to take it easy. The first option will consume more energy, but you will have a greater chance at getting promoted in the company. The rest is self explanatory.

You can spend time to study, to improve your chances of promotion, or to buy things from the narco that lives next to Pepo - to use the products against the company. You create a plan to obliterate everybody there. Poison, explosives, spikes, etc.

Getting to be CEO, CTO, CSO, etc. gives you achievements and more money to buy more expensive things. Should you be a CEO, you can turn the company into anything - selling weapons, drugs, etc. Kill the investors.
